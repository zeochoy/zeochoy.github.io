I am interested in the application of machine learning especially deep learning in oncology and development of bioinformatics tools for NGS data analysis.\n

In the past, I have worked on projects relating to microfluidics and mathematical modeling. I also have extensive wet lab experience, e.g. basic molecular biology techniques, tissue culture and drug testing.\n

As tons of people including experts, doctors and scientist foresee the advancement in artificial intelligence could accelerate the progress of personalized and precision oncology. I have a strong belief that the marriage of deep learning and next generation sequencing could be an indispensable catalyst, which fuelling my enthusiasm for applying deep learning on NGS data.
