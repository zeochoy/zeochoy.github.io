Highly motivated individual with a deep interest in leveraging artificial intelligence for precision medicine. My focus lies in applying <mark>bioinformatics & AI/ML</mark> techniques to analyze biological problems and next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. 

My skillset combines technical expertise with _hands on wet lab experience_. I'm proficient in common AI/ML frameworks and possess a strong understanding of NGS data processing pipelines, variant calling, and functional genomics analysis. Additionally, I have a solid foundation in molecular biology techniques, cell culture, and in vitro drug assays.

I'm driven by the transformative potential of AI in the realm of precision medicine. I believe the synergy of deep learning and NGS data holds the key to unlocking novel diseases diagnoses and treatment strategies.
